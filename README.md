## FirstFuel ##

#### Goal: ####

Eat 300 calories total of lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber and healthy fats within 25 minutes of waking.

#### Best practices:  ####
Use 100% plant based sources for this fuel up. 30% of calories from complex carbohydrates, 40% from plant based protein, 30% from plant based, healthy fats.  Using this standard will ensure you include the necessary dietary fiber without overdosing on fast and loose proteins, unhealthy fats, and pancreas crashing carbs which cause inflammation, pain and brain fog.

#### Beginners: ####
Use ready to eat vegan bars or vegan protein mixes while developing the habit.  Progress to homemade bars, whole food smoothies or quinoa breakfast wraps as your habit develops.
